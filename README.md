## What is PyScrum?

PyScrum streamlines project workflow management by utilizing core Scrum principles:

- **Task Management:** Create, manage, and track tasks through different statuses ("To-do", "In Progress", "Done").
- **Sprint Planning:** Organize tasks into sprints, monitor progress, and ensure clarity across your team.
- **Backlog Organization:** Maintain a structured backlog and efficiently transition tasks into active sprints.
- **Automation Integration:** Integrate PyScrum into scripts for automated task creation, progress reporting, and status updates.

PyScrum offers a practical solution to manage your projects efficiently within your command-line environment or integrated development environment (IDE).
